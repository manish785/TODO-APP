# TODO-APP
Hi, this is my second app that build using Node.js, Express js,and MongoDB. In this application, users can create their to-do lists, where they can add list of
Tasks and they delete their tasks as well. The Task created by user will be stored in the Database.Special thanks to The Coding Ninja for his great tutorial of Node js.
